First, a quick overview of the strcutre of the webpage.
In this project, there are 4 html files that are made. Which are the **home** page, **About** page, **Blog** page, and finally the **Contact** page. Furthermore, it has one css file that customizes the page. The css itself is result of a compiled scss. It is making use of scss properties such as variables, nesting, and inheritance. 
There is also the implementation of bootstrap 4 in the webpage. The buttons, grid implementation, and other properties are from bootstrap.

The navigation bar that is available on the top of the web page are all made using an unordered list tag. The bullet points are gone though as they are removed in the css file. There are css hover selector that will change background color when the mouse is hovered toward one of the option bars.

Inside the HTML file, various parts are divided using the <div> tags. Also classes and ids are made use as well.

Finally an image was also used as a profile picture in the About page.
